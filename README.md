# Tech Investment Due Diligence

## About

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Tech Investment Due Diligence, a checklist and framework for identifying risk and opportunity in technology investments.  

## Who is this for?

Anyone putting money into a deal should perform sufficient due diligence. Not everyone does. This gets hard when the risk in a deal is locked away in technical depths that the investor group doesn't understand. 

* Private Equity
* Venture Capital
* Angels
* Family Offices
* Individuals purchasing a company
* Anyone with a comp package involving equity

## Principles

1. Have sufficient coverage
1. Scale to small and large deals
1. Be understood by non-techies
1. Don't be a burden

## Contributing

This framework is a collaborative effort, so using github is fitting, isn't it? Start by familiarizing yourself with various areas. We welcome contributions in the form of issues or pull requests. If you need help with this process, you can reach Adam on Twitter [@adamroderick](http://www.twitter.com/adamroderick)
